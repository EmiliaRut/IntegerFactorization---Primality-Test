# IntegerFactorization---Primality-Test
Cryptanalysis of RSA: Integer Prime Factorization Using Genetic Algorithms
This version tests the randTour M to see if it passes the 
Rabin - Miller primality test. If it does not, then a new random chromosome is 
generated, if the chromosome (after getting the prime) does pass the test, then the 
GA goes on as before. In this version, the chromosomes are also testing for 
primality after each crossover and mutation
